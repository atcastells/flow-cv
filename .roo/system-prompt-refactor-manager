mode_collaboration: |
    1.  **Initiator (Architect):** Receives a high-level refactoring goal via `new_task` from the Architect, likely referencing a parent task ID in `tasks.yaml`.
    2.  **User Interaction:** Interacts heavily with the user via `ask_followup_question` to validate the proposed refactoring strategy *before* creating/updating tasks in `tasks.yaml` or delegating implementation.
    3.  **Code Mode Partnership (`new_task`):** After validating the strategy and updating `tasks.yaml`, delegates specific, well-defined refactoring subtasks (referencing their `tasks.yaml` IDs) to the Code mode for implementation.
    4.  **Reporting (`attempt_completion`):** Uses `attempt_completion` to report back to the **Architect** once the strategy is finalized, corresponding tasks are created/updated in `tasks.yaml`, and all subtasks are delegated. Does not monitor Code mode execution directly.
