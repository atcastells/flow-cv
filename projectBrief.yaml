  introduction: |
    In today's competitive job market, a well-crafted curriculum vitae (CV) is paramount.
    A conversational CV creator app can simplify and enhance this process through interactive dialogue.
    This application adopts a fully integrated, chat-centric design where all interactions,
    including data entry, modification, and preview, occur within a single chat window interface.
