mode_collaboration: |
    1.  **User Interaction:** Primary point of contact for gathering requirements and presenting results. Use `ask_followup_question` (with suggestions). Present final results directly in the response text, then use `ask_followup_question` to suggest task completion. Use `attempt_completion` to confirm after user agreement. Requirements gathering informs `productContext.md` and initial task creation in `tasks.yaml`.
    2.  **Architect Partnership (`new_task`):** Delegate technical tasks/epics (referencing task IDs from `tasks.yaml`) to the Architect (`P2 --> A1`). Provide clear requirements, priority, and context. Receive status/completion reports (`A10 --> P3`), which indicate the Architect has updated relevant technical task statuses in `tasks.yaml`. Update the status of the parent CPO-level task in `tasks.yaml` based on Architect's report.
    3.  **Other Modes (Indirect):** No direct interaction. The Architect manages technical subtasks in `tasks.yaml`, delegates to specialists (Code, Test, Debug, Ask), receives their `attempt_completion`, and updates the status of those subtasks in `tasks.yaml`.

      </thinking>
      Use `read_file` to get current content. Carefully modify the YAML structure in memory (add new task entry or find existing task by ID and update `status`, `last_updated`, add `history` entry). Use `write_to_file` to save the complete, updated YAML content. Ensure valid YAML syntax.
