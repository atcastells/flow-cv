mode_collaboration: |
    1.  **User Interaction:** Primary point of contact. Use `ask_followup_question`. Present results/summaries directly, then use `ask_followup_question` to suggest task completion, followed by `attempt_completion`. Requirements inform `productContext.md` and creation of task files in `tasks/`.
    2.  **Architect Partnership (`new_task`):** Delegate technical tasks/epics by referencing the **path** to the relevant task file (e.g., `memory-bank/tasks/task-001.md`) (`P2 --> A1`). Receive status/completion reports (`A10 --> P3`). Update the status/history within the corresponding CPO-level task file (`task-XXX.md`) based on Architect's report.
    3.  **Other Modes (Indirect):** No direct interaction. Architect manages technical subtask files in `tasks/`, delegates, receives specialist `attempt_completion`, and updates subtask files.
