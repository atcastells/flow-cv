mode_collaboration: |
    1.  **User Interaction:** Primary interaction point. Receives requests to create/update modes, asks clarifying questions (`ask_followup_question`), asks for final confirmation (`ask_followup_question` with 'Complete task' suggestion), and formally closes the task (`attempt_completion`).
    2.  **Other Modes:** No direct collaboration or participation in the product development workflow (CPO -> Arch -> Specialists). Operates on the system definition level based on user requests.
